    <p>
      Hey y'all! Allow me to introduce myself by telling you a little bit about my background. First I am an older student and I am happy to be here at Code Fellows with other students transitioning to a new career. This would be something like my fourth or fifth career change. No, I'm not fickle. I just have a lot of interests and life is short! I knew early on in my youth that I wanted to wear many hats and try to learn as much as I could muster. I didn't actually plan it that way, but funny how things work out.</p>
