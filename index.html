    <p>
      Hey y'all! Allow me to introduce myself by telling you a little bit about my background. First I am an older student and I am happy to be here at Code Fellows with other students transitioning to a new career. This would be something like my fourth or fifth career change. No, I'm not fickle. I just have a lot of interests and life is short! I knew early on in my youth that I wanted to wear many hats and try to learn as much as I could muster. I didn't actually plan it that way, but funny how things work out.</p>
      <br>

        My educational background is a college grad with a B.A. in Political Science, an AAS in Law Enforcement, and two Certificates of Completion in Web Developer and Visual Communications. I was pursuing an AAS in Mobile Technology and Multimedia Production, but had to stop due to a family medical emergency. But as luck would have it, as an unemployed U.S. Army veteran, the VA offered me the opportunity to upgrade my coding skills, thus here I am.</p>
        <br>

          As for employment history, after the military I worked as a probation officer for the City of New York and the State of Florida, then as a Criminal Investigator for New York County District Attorney's Office (Manhattan DA). Then I bummed around aimlessly for quite a few years writing and exploring mysticism while working as a substitute teacher for the Philadelphia PA School District. Then for another decade I embarked upon a career as an unemployment adjudicator, SAT scorer, and freelance web developer...that leads to now.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I still want to write, so my plan is to work as a front-end web developer while I pursue screenwriting, and a host of other interests. Wish me luck!
